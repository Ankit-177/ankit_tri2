## Project overview:

Our ML project was a college prediction model that predicted whether a student would be admitted, waitlisted, or rejected from a specific college based on data like SAT score, GPA, and number of extracurriculars. We had a synthetic data set that is accurate but not representative of a real-life college, as real data sets or blocked behind privacy and legal barriers.

## Score from Mr. Mortensen
<mark><strong>2.7/3</mark></strong>

### Mr. Mortensen's comments:
- The quality of our project and code is very good. However, the volume of commits is not as high, showing a little less collaboration than is deemed exemplary. Therefore, we could have done a better job with making little, incremental changes rather than committing large changes all at once.
