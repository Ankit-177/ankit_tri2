# Project Summary:
- Considering the difficulty of the college application process, we have created an app that allows students to organize their application progress to ensure efficiency and ease of access. Our CPT project is an application that allows users to create their own, personalized accounts and login using the same credentials to track their application progress from a variety of colleges stored in our database.

# My Features:
- I created the sign up and login features along with adding a new `email` parameter to our SQLite database. This allows users to enter their email address while creating an account, allowing the application to store the email to be constantly used in the application process for each college. Additionally, I created the welcome page that greeted the users upon visiting the website and allowed them to navigate to the login page. I also created the error pages that redirected the user to the appropriate error page when using the wrong login credentials or trying to navigate to a non-existent subpage.
