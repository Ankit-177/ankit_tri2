    "Complete these five free response questions and send them to Taj on slack by December 21, 11:59 pm. You will be graded on how much effort you put into your answer. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the difference between open source and open access? \n",
    "- Open source technology refers to technology that is open to public modification, as the source code is open for modification by anyone. For example, Python is an open source software as its development relies on public collaboration; this is the case even to this day. On the other hand, open access refers to technology that is accessible but not modifiable by the public. An example of an open access technology is Google, as it is accesible by anyone but cannot be modified in terms of software functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is the importance of copyright?\n",
    "- Copyright is important because it protects the value of a novel technology or product created by an author or a group of authors. It protects the technology from unlawful or unwanted usage, as multiple laws surround the usage of copyrighted products. As a result, the safety blanket of copryright laws motivates creators to develop their technologies with no fear of data theft or unlawful content modification, creating a safe development environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is a way people can harm individuals or groups through open source data? \n",
    "- People can harm individuals or groups in many ways with access to their open source data. Malefactors can download viruses and completely erase the open source data that was available to them in order to defame or destroy the livelihoods of the creators. Furthermore, malefactors can steal the technology and claim it as their own, completely discrediting the original work done by the original creators.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What term describes the uequal distribution of access to technology? \n",
    "- The term that describes the unequal distribution of access to technology is \"digital divide\". Although most of the resources found on the internet can be accessed and used by anybody with the right technology, there might be groups of people who do not have the right technology to use the features provided by the internet. Only people with the knowledge and the hardware to access the many resources available on the internet can take advantage of them, creating a digital divide between these people and the ones who do not have access to the internet itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. How do you see intellectual property in 20 years (be creative)?\n",
    "- With the advent of secure technologies such as online financing and the shift of personal data storage to online avenues, I see intellectual property and the laws surrounding it becoming more strict and secure in the next 20 years. With such critical data online, intellectual property is only going to get more secure as time goes on in order to protect this data from malefactors. Conversely, with the advancement of AI technologies, intellectual property could become less and less valuable as AI creations overtake the work done by human developers, making the power of mass, high-quality creation available for anybody to exploit. At such a point, intellectal property would become almost meaningless, as powerful data stealing and technology creation is at everyone's fingertips."
